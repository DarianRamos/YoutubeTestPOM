# YoutubeTestPOM
Repository for testing Youtube page.

The project was made with [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/ruby/). 
[Selenium](https://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver/versions/2.53.4?locale=es), [Webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) were used to develop it.

The project contains a jpg image of a draft of the object modeling, unfortunately due to time and learning curve I was not able to implement inheritance, configuration files or data structure.
